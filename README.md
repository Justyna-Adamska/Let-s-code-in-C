# C Language in practice

This repository is intended to serve as a tool for learning C language. Through practical examples I am going to explore the power of the C language.

## 07.09.2022 

I started with a single main function that prints values of linear function. I also added for loop in order to simplify my code.

### .gitignore

In order to avoid commiting .swp and .out files I added .gitignore to my repository.

## 13.09.2022

I altered main.c file in such a way, that all operations and calculations are made in separate functions and function "main"only  calls these functions. The result of the program is the same as in the version from 07.09.2022 but the code is more open to modifications and becomes more versatile. Additionally I made sure that single function encorporates one operation. Instead of making one complex function I created 5 smaller ones. This is easier to modify and to manage in case of future alterations.
